# IOS-AimBot-Standoff-2
This project is a template for creating an AIMBot for the game Standoff 2 on iOS using Theos, which is a set of tools for developing tweaks and applications for jailbroken iOS devices. AIMBot is software that automatically aims and shoots enemies in the game, giving the player an advantage in combat.
